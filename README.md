Thought Render Music Site

These files can be seen live at http://thoughtrender.com/music

The site is fully responsive and uses html5, css3, javascript, SVGs that degrade to PNGs, a custom audio player that I built which works on all devices down to Android 2.3.

I also use image 'strips' to put more than one image in a single file to reduce the amount of server calls.

Please do not use any of this code without my permission!!

Thanks!
