In Zen Buddhism an enso is a hand drawn circle with one or two uninhibited brushstrokes to express a moment when the mind is free to let the body create. This definition sets the tone for this ambitiously fluid release of deep dubstep vibes. The first track, Irreversible, is like diving into and immersing oneself into a koi pond of bass and rhythmic keys. It definitely creates a space for both contemplation and creation.  Minescape, the second track, is pure sultry sexiness. It continues the meditative journey with plush, warm keys drifting through a rain of reverberating vocal stabs. The final track, Sativa Satva, brings the mood full circle from reflection, to expression and back, for infinity. The well placed percussion, the builds and releases of tension, the deep bass, blend together to tell a story nothing short of perfection. The Enso Ango EP is food for the mind, body and soul!'>

The title track 'Data' is pure ear candy with it mellow haunting vocals, penetrating bass and futuristic keys. 'Death Rattle' takes us deeper into space with it's evolving dubby rhythm. The crystal clear bass smashes through layers of static modulation and expertly panned percussion. Frozen City's liquid melody is solidified by it's relentlessly cold bass line. This track reminds us why we fell in love with dubstep in the first place. From tambourine to kick, 'Dub Runner' is a percussion masterpiece. It's ultra deep melancholy bass contrasts smooth transitions creating an epic galactic space between the listener's ears. This is a can't miss release.">

All four tracks on this EP are deep, dark and heavy the way that dubstep was intended to be. The title track, Deletion combines a dark melody and a dubby rhythm with a teeth grinding bassline, sure to make any above ground dwelling feel underground. Like the title states, Wake Up comes through with an uplifting vibe. Vocal stabs cascade around tight kicks and perfectly spaced percussion while the modulation steadily bleeds tension. Tunnel shakes the basement ringing in at 144 bpms. It's futuristic sounding synth work is balanced with panning Congo drums and an 808 cowbell for bonus points. Mystical provides the perfect outro, with its epic Arabic sounding flavor. Truly a masterpiece with it's roller coaster of builds, drops and heavy bass.">
